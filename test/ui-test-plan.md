# UI Test Plan

## Startup-error sessions

Run each startup-error case in a separate fresh Charlie process before the main session below.

### UI-STARTUP-01 — Reject a saved task with missing fields

**Aim:** Verify that a corrupted saved task reports a friendly error instead of causing an array-index failure.

**Rationale:** A deadline requires its type, status, description, and deadline fields in the save file.

Before starting Charlie, create `data/charlie.txt` with exactly this line:

```text
D | Not done | missing deadline
```

Start Charlie, then enter:

```text
list
bye
```

**Expected startup output after the banner and greeting:**

```text
Error loading saved tasks: Invalid number of fields in saved task.
```

**Expected output after entering `list`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    ____________________________________________________________
```

**Expected output after entering `bye`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STARTUP-02 — Handle a save-file read failure

**Aim:** Verify that an I/O failure while reading the save path reports a friendly error.

**Rationale:** The program should not expose an uncaught `IOException` or Java stack trace when saved tasks cannot be read.

Before starting Charlie, remove the previous test file and create a directory named `data/charlie.txt`. Start Charlie, then enter:

```text
bye
```

**Expected startup output after the banner and greeting:**

```text
Error loading saved tasks: Could not read the saved task file.
```

**Expected output after entering `bye`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

Leave the `data/charlie.txt` directory in place for the following save-error case.

### UI-STORAGE-02 — Handle a save-file write failure

**Aim:** Verify that an I/O failure while saving tasks reports a friendly error.

**Rationale:** A save failure should be handled by Charlie's command loop instead of exposing a Java stack trace or terminating the program.

Using the `data/charlie.txt` directory left by `UI-STARTUP-02`, start a fresh Charlie process. Then enter:

```text
todo unsaved task
list
bye
```

**Expected startup output after the banner and greeting:**

```text
Error loading saved tasks: Could not read the saved task file.
```

**Expected output after entering `todo unsaved task`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Could not save tasks.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-03 — Keep the list empty after a failed addition

**Aim:** Verify that a task is not added to the in-memory list when it cannot be saved.

**Rationale:** The saved file and current task list should represent the same state after a failed addition.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    ____________________________________________________________
```

**Expected output after entering `bye`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

After this case, remove the `data/charlie.txt` directory before continuing.

### UI-STORAGE-01 — Start without a save file

**Aim:** Verify that Charlie starts with an empty task list when no save file exists.

**Rationale:** A missing save file represents a first-time user and must not be treated as a loading error.

Before starting Charlie, ensure that `data/charlie.txt` does not exist. Then enter:

```text
list
bye
```

**Expected output after entering `list`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    ____________________________________________________________
```

**Expected output after entering `bye`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-COMMAND-EXIT-01 — Terminate after the exit command

**Aim:** Verify that Charlie terminates immediately after responding to `bye`.

**Rationale:** Extracting exit behavior into `ExitCommand` must preserve both the farewell and the exit signal.

Run this case in a separate fresh Charlie process with no save file. Enter:

```text
bye
```

**Expected output after entering `bye`:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

**Expected process state:** Charlie terminates without waiting for another command.

## Save-failure consistency session

Run the cases in this section in one fresh Charlie process before the main session. First, create `data/charlie.txt` with exactly these lines:

```text
T | Not done | stable task
T | Done | completed task
```

Start Charlie and wait until it has loaded the tasks. Then move the save file aside and create an empty directory named `data/charlie.txt`. This forces subsequent save attempts to fail while preserving the two tasks already loaded in memory.

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-STARTUP — Load tasks before forcing save failures

**Aim:** Verify that the consistency session starts normally with its two-task fixture.

**Expected startup output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
      ____ _   _    _    ____  _     ___ _____
     / ___| | | |  / \  |  _ \| |   |_ _| ____|
    | |   | |_| | / _ \ | |_) | |    | ||  _|
    | |___|  _  |/ ___ \|  _ <| |___ | || |___
     \____|_| |_/_/   \_\_| \_\_____|___|_____|
    Hello! I'm Charlie!
    What do you want to do today?
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-01 — Reject marking when saving fails

**Input:**

```text
mark 1
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Could not save tasks.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-02 — Keep status unchanged after failed marking

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] stable task
    2.[T][X] completed task
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-03 — Reject unmarking when saving fails

**Input:**

```text
unmark 2
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Could not save tasks.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-04 — Keep status unchanged after failed unmarking

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] stable task
    2.[T][X] completed task
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-05 — Reject deletion when saving fails

**Input:**

```text
delete 1
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Could not save tasks.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-06 — Keep tasks after failed deletion

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] stable task
    2.[T][X] completed task
    ____________________________________________________________
```

### UI-STORAGE-CONSISTENCY-07 — Exit the consistency session

**Input:**

```text
bye
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

After this session, remove the `data/charlie.txt` directory before preparing the main session fixture.

## Session setup

- Required Java version: Java 25
- Compile command: `.\gradlew.bat classes`
- Run command: `java -cp build/classes/java/main charlie.Charlie`
- Before starting Charlie, create `data/charlie.txt` with exactly these lines:

```text
T | Done | loaded todo
D | Not done | loaded deadline | 2026-09-18
E | Done | loaded event | 2026-09-18T09:00 | 2026-09-18T10:00
```

- Run all test cases below in one fresh program session and in the listed order.
- Compare output exactly, except that CRLF and LF line endings are considered equivalent and trailing spaces at the end of a line are ignored.
- Each expected-output block starts with the horizontal line printed after entering the command and ends with that command's final horizontal line.
- Console input echo is part of the transcript but is not part of the expected application output.

## UI-STARTUP-03 — Display the startup greeting

**Aim:** Verify that Charlie displays its banner and greeting when the main test session starts.

**Rationale:** Extracting console interactions into a `Ui` class must preserve the startup presentation exactly.

**Input:** Start Charlie and wait for the initial output. Do not enter a command yet.

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
      ____ _   _    _    ____  _     ___ _____
     / ___| | | |  / \  |  _ \| |   |_ _| ____|
    | |   | |_| | / _ \ | |_) | |    | ||  _|
    | |___|  _  |/ ___ \|  _ <| |___ | || |___
     \____|_| |_/_/   \_\_| \_\_____|___|_____|
    Hello! I'm Charlie!
    What do you want to do today?
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-LOAD-01 — List tasks loaded at startup

**Aim:** Verify that Charlie restores todos, deadlines, events, and their completion states from the save file.

**Rationale:** Listing all preloaded task types confirms that startup loading reconstructs each saved field correctly.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][X] loaded todo
    2.[D][ ] loaded deadline (by: Sep 18 2026)
    3.[E][X] loaded event (from: Sep 18 2026, 9:00 AM to: Sep 18 2026, 10:00 AM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-LOAD-02 — Remove the loaded event

**Aim:** Remove the preloaded event as part of returning to an empty list for the existing test sequence.

**Rationale:** This also verifies that a task reconstructed from disk behaves like a newly created task.

**Input:**

```text
delete 3
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Noted. I've removed this task:
      [E][X] loaded event (from: Sep 18 2026, 9:00 AM to: Sep 18 2026, 10:00 AM)
    Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-LOAD-03 — Remove the loaded deadline

**Aim:** Remove the preloaded deadline before running the original empty-list test sequence.

**Rationale:** Deleting a loaded deadline checks that its list position and stored data are valid.

**Input:**

```text
delete 2
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Noted. I've removed this task:
      [D][ ] loaded deadline (by: Sep 18 2026)
    Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-LOAD-04 — Remove the loaded todo

**Aim:** Return to an empty task list before running the original test sequence.

**Rationale:** Removing the final loaded task also verifies that saving an empty task list clears the save file.

**Input:**

```text
delete 1
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Noted. I've removed this task:
      [T][X] loaded todo
    Now you have 0 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-INDEX-01 — Reject marking when the task list is empty

**Aim:** Verify that `mark` reports an empty task list before any new tasks are added.

**Rationale:** Moving range validation into `TaskList` must preserve the dedicated empty-list error.

**Input:**

```text
mark 1
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    There are no tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-01 — Add a todo

**Aim:** Verify that `todo` creates an incomplete todo with the correct description and confirmation.

**Rationale:** This is the simplest task-creation command, so it establishes that task descriptions, status symbols, and task counts are displayed correctly.

**Input:**

```text
todo borrow book
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Got it. I've added this task:
      [T][ ] borrow book
    Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-ADD-01 — List tasks after adding a todo

**Aim:** Verify that listing immediately after adding a todo shows the new task.

**Rationale:** Extracting task creation into `AddCommand` must add the task to the shared `TaskList`.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-02 — Add a deadline

**Aim:** Verify that `/by` separates the deadline description from its date or time.

**Rationale:** A deadline contains two user-provided fields, making this case necessary to check both delimiter parsing and deadline formatting.

**Input:**

```text
deadline return book /by 2026-09-20
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Got it. I've added this task:
      [D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-03 — Add an event

**Aim:** Verify that `/from` and `/to` separate the event description, start, and end.

**Rationale:** An event uses two delimiters and three fields, so it checks the most complex task parser and its output order.

**Input:**

```text
event project meeting /from 2026-09-21 1400 /to 2026-09-23 1600
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Got it. I've added this task:
      [E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-04 — List all tasks

**Aim:** Verify that `list` displays every task in insertion order with one-based numbering.

**Rationale:** This case uses the state created by the preceding cases to check that different task types are retained and displayed together correctly.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-FIND-01 — Find multiple tasks using different keyword capitalization

**Aim:** Verify that `find` displays every task whose description contains the keyword regardless of capitalization.

**Rationale:** An uppercase keyword should match both lowercase book-related descriptions while omitting the unrelated event, and result numbering should be consecutive.

**Input:**

```text
find BOOK
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the matching tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-FIND-02 — Find a task using a phrase

**Aim:** Verify that all text after `find` is used as the search phrase.

**Rationale:** Splitting the input only once preserves the complete multi-word phrase instead of searching only for its first word.

**Input:**

```text
find project meeting
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the matching tasks in your list:
    1.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-FIND-03 — Report that no task matches

**Aim:** Verify that `find` clearly reports an unsuccessful search.

**Rationale:** A heading without a result or explanation could leave the user unsure whether the command completed.

**Input:**

```text
find missing
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the matching tasks in your list:
    No task contains this keyword.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-FIND-04 — Reject `find` without search text

**Aim:** Verify that the `find` command requires a keyword or phrase.

**Rationale:** Missing search text must produce a friendly error instead of an array-index failure.

**Input:**

```text
find
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please provide a keyword to find.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-FIND-05 — Keep tasks unchanged after searching

**Aim:** Verify that all original tasks remain unchanged after the keyword searches.

**Rationale:** `find` is a read-only command and must not alter task contents, status, order, or persistence.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-01 — Find a deadline on an exact date

**Aim:** Verify that `on` prints a deadline whose date exactly matches the requested date.

**Rationale:** Deadline dates represent a single day rather than a date range.

**Input:**

```text
on 2026-09-20
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks occurring on 2026-09-20:
    1.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-02 — Find an event spanning the requested date

**Aim:** Verify that `on` prints an event when the requested date falls within its date range.

**Rationale:** The event starts on September 21 and ends on September 23, so it should include September 22 even though neither endpoint is on that date.

**Input:**

```text
on 2026-09-22
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks occurring on 2026-09-22:
    1.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-03 — Report no matching dated tasks

**Aim:** Verify that `on` reports when no deadline or event occurs on the requested date.

**Rationale:** Printing only a heading could leave the user unsure whether the search completed successfully.

**Input:**

```text
on 2026-09-19
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks occurring on 2026-09-19:
    No deadlines or events occur on this date.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-04 — Reject `on` without a date

**Aim:** Verify that `on` requires exactly one date argument.

**Rationale:** Accessing a missing argument must not cause an array-index failure.

**Input:**

```text
on
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please provide exactly one date in yyyy-MM-dd format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-05 — Reject extra `on` arguments

**Aim:** Verify that `on` rejects input after its single date argument.

**Rationale:** Silently ignoring extra input can hide a user's typing mistake.

**Input:**

```text
on 2026-09-20 extra
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please provide exactly one date in yyyy-MM-dd format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-06 — Reject a weekday name

**Aim:** Verify that `on` rejects a weekday that does not identify one exact calendar date.

**Rationale:** `Sunday` is ambiguous because it does not state which week's Sunday is intended.

**Input:**

```text
on Sunday
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Date must be a valid date in yyyy-MM-dd format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-DATE-07 — Reject an impossible calendar date

**Aim:** Verify that `on` rejects a correctly shaped but nonexistent date.

**Rationale:** Calendar validation must prevent dates such as February 30 from being searched.

**Input:**

```text
on 2026-02-30
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Date must be a valid date in yyyy-MM-dd format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-ON-01 — Keep tasks unchanged after date searches

**Aim:** Verify that listing after the date searches displays every original task unchanged.

**Rationale:** Extracting date-search behavior into `OnCommand` must keep the operation read-only.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-05 — Reject an invalid command

**Aim:** Verify that an unknown command displays a helpful error without terminating Charlie.

**Rationale:** Custom exceptions should be handled inside the input loop so the chatbot remains available after invalid input.

**Input:**

```text
hello
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Oops, this is an invalid command
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-06 — Continue after an invalid command

**Aim:** Verify that Charlie still accepts commands after handling an invalid command.

**Rationale:** Printing an error is insufficient if the exception causes the input loop to end.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-07 — Mark a task as done

**Aim:** Verify that `mark` changes the selected task's status to done and displays the updated task.

**Rationale:** Marking changes existing task state, so the response must identify the selected task and show its completed status symbol.

**Input:**

```text
mark 2
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Nice! I've marked this task as done:
      [D][X] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-MARK-01 — List tasks after marking

**Aim:** Verify that listing immediately after `mark` shows the selected task as done.

**Rationale:** Extracting mark behavior into `MarkCommand` must retain the mutation in `TaskList`.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][X] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-08 — Unmark a task

**Aim:** Verify that `unmark` changes the selected task's status back to not done and displays the updated task.

**Rationale:** Unmarking is the inverse state transition and must restore the incomplete status symbol for the same task.

**Input:**

```text
unmark 2
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    OK, I've marked this task not done yet:
      [D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-UNMARK-01 — List tasks after unmarking

**Aim:** Verify that listing immediately after `unmark` shows the selected task as not done.

**Rationale:** Extracting unmark behavior into `UnmarkCommand` must retain the mutation in `TaskList`.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-09 — Delete the third task

**Aim:** Verify that `delete 3` removes the selected event and reports the reduced task count.

**Rationale:** This directly checks the successful deletion behavior supplied by the user, including one-based indexing and the deleted task's exact representation.

**Input:**

```text
delete 3
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Noted. I've removed this task:
      [E][ ] project meeting (from: Sep 21 2026, 2:00 PM to: Sep 23 2026, 4:00 PM)
    Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-DELETE-01 — Reject deleting the removed position again

**Aim:** Verify that deleting task 3 again fails because only two tasks remain.

**Rationale:** Extracting deletion into `DeleteCommand` must update the size of the shared `TaskList`.

**Input:**

```text
delete 3
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a task number from 1 to 2.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-10 — List tasks after deletion

**Aim:** Verify that the deleted task is absent and the remaining tasks keep consecutive one-based numbering.

**Rationale:** A confirmation alone does not prove that deletion updated the stored list correctly.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-11 — Reject an empty command

**Aim:** Verify that submitting an empty line displays a helpful error.

**Rationale:** Empty input must be handled without terminating Charlie or producing inconsistent response separators.

**Input:** Submit one empty line.

```text

```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a command.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-12 — Reject a todo without a description

**Aim:** Verify that `todo` requires a description.

**Rationale:** A task without a description cannot convey useful work to the user.

**Input:**

```text
todo
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    The task description cannot be empty.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-13 — Reject a deadline without `/by`

**Aim:** Verify that a deadline requires its `/by` delimiter.

**Rationale:** Without `/by`, Charlie cannot separate the task description from its deadline.

**Input:**

```text
deadline return book
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    A deadline must include /by followed by a date.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-14 — Reject a deadline without a description

**Aim:** Verify that a deadline requires text before `/by`.

**Rationale:** Supplying a date alone does not describe a task.

**Input:**

```text
deadline /by 2026-09-20
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Description cannot be empty.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-15 — Reject a deadline without a date

**Aim:** Verify that a deadline requires text after `/by`.

**Rationale:** An empty deadline value would create an incomplete Deadline object.

**Input:**

```text
deadline return book /by
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Deadline cannot be empty.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-PARSER-01 — Reject an event without delimiters

**Aim:** Verify that an event command requires both `/from` and `/to` delimiters.

**Rationale:** Without the delimiters, the parser cannot separate the description, start, and end fields.

**Input:**

```text
event meeting
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Need to include /from or /to fields.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-16 — Reject an event without a start

**Aim:** Verify that an event requires text between `/from` and `/to`.

**Rationale:** An event with no starting value is incomplete.

**Input:**

```text
event meeting /from /to 2026-09-21 1600
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    from/to fields cannot be empty.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-17 — Reject an event without an end

**Aim:** Verify that an event requires text after `/to`.

**Rationale:** An event with no ending value is incomplete.

**Input:**

```text
event meeting /from 2026-09-21 1400 /to
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    from/to fields cannot be empty.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-18 — Reject `mark` without a task number

**Aim:** Verify that `mark` requires exactly one task number.

**Rationale:** Charlie cannot identify which task to update when the number is absent.

**Input:**

```text
mark
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please provide exactly one task number.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-19 — Reject a non-numeric task number

**Aim:** Verify that `mark` rejects text in place of a number.

**Rationale:** Number parsing failures should become friendly CharlieException messages rather than terminate the program.

**Input:**

```text
mark abc
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a valid task number.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-20 — Reject an out-of-range task number

**Aim:** Verify that `mark` rejects a number outside the current task list.

**Rationale:** Preventing invalid array access avoids crashes and accidental updates.

**Input:**

```text
mark 999
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a task number from 1 to 2.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-INDEX-02 — Reject task number zero

**Aim:** Verify that `mark 0` is rejected as below the one-based task range.

**Rationale:** After range validation moves from `Parser` to `TaskList`, zero must still produce the friendly range error.

**Input:**

```text
mark 0
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a task number from 1 to 2.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-TASKLIST-01 — Reject deletion outside the task list

**Aim:** Verify that `delete` rejects a task number outside the current list.

**Rationale:** An invalid deletion must not access or change the task collection.

**Input:**

```text
delete 999
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Please enter a task number from 1 to 2.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-TASKLIST-02 — Keep tasks after an invalid deletion

**Aim:** Verify that an unsuccessful deletion does not change the task list.

**Rationale:** Rejecting an invalid index is insufficient if the attempted mutation still removes or changes a task.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-21 — Reject a deadline that is not an ISO date

**Aim:** Verify that deadline values must use the `yyyy-MM-dd` input format.

**Rationale:** Storing deadlines as `LocalDate` requires Charlie to reject text that cannot be converted into a real calendar date without terminating the program.

**Input:**

```text
deadline return book /by Sunday
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Deadline must be a valid date in yyyy-MM-dd format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-22 — Reject an event with an invalid date-time

**Aim:** Verify that event start and end values use the `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm` format.

**Rationale:** Event values must be convertible into real `LocalDateTime` objects without terminating Charlie.

**Input:**

```text
event meeting /from Monday 2pm /to Monday 4pm
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Event dates must use the yyyy-MM-dd HHmm format.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-23 — Reject an event that does not end after it starts

**Aim:** Verify that an event's end date-time must occur after its start date-time.

**Rationale:** An event ending before or exactly when it starts does not represent a valid time interval.

**Input:**

```text
event meeting /from 2026-09-21 1600 /to 2026-09-21 1400
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Event end must be after its start.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-01 — Recognize a command with leading whitespace

**Aim:** Verify that command recognition continues to ignore whitespace before a command keyword.

**Rationale:** Renaming the internal command type must not change how the parser recognizes user commands.

**Input:**

```text
   list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-COMMAND-02 — Keep the task list unchanged after listing

**Aim:** Verify that running `list` again displays the same tasks in the same order.

**Rationale:** Extracting list behavior into a command object must keep `list` as a read-only operation.

**Input:**

```text
list
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] borrow book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Sep 20 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## UI-24 — Exit after persistence checks

**Aim:** End the test session normally and verify the final persisted task list.

**Rationale:** The final file contents confirm that additions, status changes, and deletion have all been written to disk.

**Input:**

```text
bye
```

**Expected output:**

```text
    ____________________________________________________________
    Goodbye! See you next time.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

**Expected `data/charlie.txt` contents after exit:**

```text
T | Not done | borrow book
D | Not done | return book | 2026-09-20
```
